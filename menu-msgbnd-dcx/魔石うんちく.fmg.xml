<text id="11000025">A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes relate to "blood," including "Communion,"
which raises the maximum number of blood vials
one may carry.

of communion.</text>

<text id="11000029">A Caryll rune discovered by the old hunter Ludwig along with the Holy Moonlight Sword.
Boosts amount of life recovered by rallying.

The rune for "Radiance," adopted by the sworn
Executioners under Logarius' command.

and no matter what the circumstances, would

who serve the undead queen, Annalise.</text>
<text id="12000005">A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes contain a nuance of "Blood," including the rune of "Corruption," associated with the oath of the corrupt.

Yet the corrupt are heretics in the eyes of the Church, and thus subject to the wrath of the Executioners.</text>

Vermin writhe within filth, and are the root of man's impurity. Crush all vermin without hesitation.</text>
<text id="12000008">After repeated experiments in controlling the scourge of beasts, the gentle "Embrace" rune was discovered.

When its implementation failed, the "Embrace" became a forbidden rune, but this knowledge became a foundation of the Healing Church.

Those who swear this oath take on a ghastly form, and enjoy accentuated transformation effects, especially while wielding a beast weapon.</text>
<text id="12000009">A Caryll Rune envisioned by Adeline, patient of the research hall.
A transcription of the inhuman, sticky whispers that reveal the nature of a celestial attendant.

who is often the only thing standing after a bloodbath.</text>
<text id="16010001">A blood gem that fortifies weapons and adds various properties.

Droplet blood gems are special gems that adapt to various weapons and shapes.

Created from a shining silver doll tear, this blood gem is a quiet but unfaltering friend that continually restores HP, the life essence of a hunter. Perhaps the doll's creator had wished for just such a friend, albeit in vain.</text>
