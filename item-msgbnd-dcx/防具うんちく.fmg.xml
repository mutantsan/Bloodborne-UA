both uncommonly kind and dreadfully foolish.

Djura felt defeated by the state of Old Yharnam,
and renounced his hunter's vows.</text>
<text id="242000">Attire of the retired hunter Djura.
Painted with ash in a ceremony to ward off blood.

Djura is known through his contact with the Powder Kegs,
the heretics of the workshop. He is said to have been
both uncommonly kind and dreadfully foolish.

<text id="250000">One of the precious secrets of Cainhurst.
The old king's crown is said to reveal illusions,
and expose a mirage that hides a secret.

And so Logarius donned the crown of his own volition,
determined to prevent a single soul from stumbling
upon the vile secret. 

What visions did he see, sitting serenely upon his 
new throne?</text>
<text id="260000">An iron helm resembling an upside-down bucket.

A single hole allows one to peek out with a single eye, which is probably all that its original owner had.

The iron helm is passed down among masters of the League. Valtr had in fact lost the ability to see vermin long ago.</text>
<text id="270000">Iron helmet worn by hunters of the Unseen Village.

Removing the hood reveals something reminiscent
of a warrior of a previous age.

This headwear is made of metal, a rarity for hunter garb,
and has high defense, but only against physical attacks.</text>
<text id="280000">Hat worn by hunters who admire formality.

Some hunters place an emphasis on form, as seen by
the use of the threaded cane.

For them, formality, beauty, and justice are the very
essence of our humanity, and precisely what keeps
hunters from becoming something else.</text>
<text id="281000">One of the standard articles of hunter attire fashioned at the workshop, this one without the cape that wipes away blood.

A fine piece of hunter attire that provides stable defense to anyone facing Yharnam's beastly threat.

Allows one to stalk beasts unannounced, by cover of night.</text>
<text id="290000">Attire of special Church doctors.

These doctors are superiors to the black preventative hunters, and specialists in experimentally backed blood ministration and the scourge of the beast.

They believe that medicine is not a means of treatment but rather a method for research, and that some knowledge can only be obtained by exposing oneself to sickness.</text>

<text id="301000">Uniform of the students of Byrgenwerth, a bygone institute learning. This alternative lacks the thick cape.

The Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally borrows heavily from its uniform design.

The focus not on knowledge, or thought, but on pure pretension would surely bring Master Willem to despair, if only he knew.</text>
<text id="311000">A finely tailored bordeaux dress.

Worn by the nobles of the old bloodline that traces back
to the forsaken Castle Cainhurst.</text>
<text id="313000">Shoes worn by Arianna, woman of the night 
in the Cathedral Ward.

Innocent and cute, in contrast with its owner.</text>
<text id="320000">Common Yharnam cap.

Well-worn and losing its shape.</text>
<text id="321000">Common Yharnam clothing.

Well-worn and damp with sweat.</text>
<text id="330000">Mask of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging to the older of the two.

The twins grew up in silent kinship with a poisonous snake. Eventually they learned human ways, and became hunters.

When they discovered vermin even in their beloved snake, the younger brother is said to have murdered the older.</text>
<text id="331000">Garb of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging to the older of the two.

Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected their beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.</text>
<text id="332000">Gloves of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging to the older of the two.

<text id="340000">Certain Church hunters obfuscate their identities and slip into the nooks and crannies of the city.
This is the garb that allows these harrowed individuals to go unnoticed.

These hunters are keen to early signs of the scourge, serving as a first line of defense against its outbreak.
Or perhaps, when the time is ripe, they find signs of the scourge where there are none. It just goes to show, the corner beggar is not always who he seems.</text>

<text id="350000">Old hunter cap with a wide brim that hides their sharp gaze.

In the old days, when hunters were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.</text>
<text id="351000">Old hunter garb.

One day, the hunters disappeared, and Yharnamites began to whisper of the hunters' sin.

Drunk with blood, chasing after beasts, they would pass on to the Nightmare, every last one of them.</text>
<text id="352000">Old hunter gauntlets made of brass to protect their weapon-bearing hands.

At the time, some hunters believed that certain metals would ward off beast blood.
On a night of the hunt, it is no wonder that some resort to superstition.</text>
<text id="353000">Old hunter trousers that protected countless hunters from the beasts in an older age.

A widespread belief of the period was that "beast blood crept up the right leg," and this led to the double-wrapped belt.</text>
<text id="360000">Old hunter top hat warped by blood stains.

In the old days, when hunters were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.</text>
<text id="361000">Old hunter garb decorated with brass trinkets.

<text id="370000">Among the first hunters, all students of Gehrman, was the lady hunter Maria. This was her hunter's cap, crafted in Cainhurst.

Maria is distantly related to the undead queen, but had great admiration for Gehrman, unaware of his curious mania.</text>

<text id="381000">Once upon a time, a troupe of foreign constables chased a beast all the way to Yharnam, and this is what they wore.
The constables became victims of the beast, except for one survivor, who in turn devoured the creature whole, all by himself.

This fable is a favorite among Yharnamites, who are partial to any stories of pompous, intolerant foreigners who suffer for their ignorance.
It makes the blood taste that much sweeter.</text>

<text id="390000">The scalp of a horrible cleric beast, indicating that hunter Brador, a Healing Church assassin, had killed a compatriot.

Afterward, he wore his ally's own scalp, and hid himself away, deep below in a cell. The Church provided him with a single, soundless bell of death, to ensure their secrets would be kept.</text>
<text id="391000">The bloodied hide of a horrible cleric beast, pulled over the back. Without the attached beast hide, this foreign garb wouldn't raise anyone's eyebrows.

Brador donned a compatriot's beastly scalp and hide while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this hide were from that day.</text>
<text id="392000">Bloodied arm bands.

<text id="400000">A standard hunter's hat, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer.

This hat and staff were given to him when he became a hunter and confederate of the League.</text>
<text id="401000">Garb of a distant Eastern land, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer.

This Eastern warrior pursued a beast for honorable revenge, then became a hunter of the League. But when he stared straight into impurity, it drove him mad.</text>
<text id="402000">Old hunter arm bands wound tightly to prevent infection with the scourge.

Of course, the idea that the scourge was infectious was pure hearsay.</text>

But if you do, listen carefully, for the sticky sound. Drip, drop. As water, seeping up from the depths, slowly, steadily.</text>
